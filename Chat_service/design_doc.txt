server:
	Our main function handles all clients that intially connect. This means that all instructions relating to chatrooms are handled through the server's main function. In order to determine what is coming in and from which client we use the select() method. This allows are server to watch file descriptors (clients) for commands and handles them concurrently. 

	Once the server receives a command that command is sent to a function that parses the command and runs the appropriate function. When a command for server creation is received a new server is created and run on a separate thread. The information for the chatroom is saved on the main server. When a join command is received the server returns a status and a port number to connect to. When a list command is received the server just sends back a status message along with a list of the open chatrooms. Delete sends a message saying that the chat room is being closed and closes the connection.

client:
	The client is very simple. It connects to a server through ip address and port number. Once connected it can send a command to the server, if the command is not a join, it closes the file descriptor and reconnects. Once it sends the message it creates a reply structed which is used for determining next steps. If the client joins a chatroom it starts to listen for responses from either the server or stdin for either displaying messages from other users or taking in messages to be sent to the server. 

chatroom:
	Chatrooms will basically be like other servers except that instead of closing ports after commands keep the connectin. We will use select to determine when clients connect and then whenever a client sends a message to the server the server will send a message back to the other clients. Also if the chatrooms for some reason shuts down (due to a delete) the chatroom will send out a message to all users saying the chatroom is shutting down and they will be disconnected.
